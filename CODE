*(d) Draw a scatter plot of the crimerate against distance. Do your results suggest that crossing the cutoff raises conscription?

scatter crimerate distance

*(e) Now run a two-stage least squares regression to estimate the effect of conscripted on crimerate in a regression discontinuity design. Use local linear regression with a bandwidth of 100. To allow the slopes to be different above and below the cutoff, first generate the interaction of distance with eligible: gen distanceXelig = distance*eligible. Then estimate: ivregress 2sls crimerate (conscripted=eligible) distance distanceXelig,r first. Explain the command, and interpret both the first- and second-stage results. Do the results confirm your interpretation of the scatter plots in parts (c) and (d) of the question?

gen distanceXelig = distance*eligible
ivregress 2sls crimerate (conscripted=eligible) distance distanceXelig,r

*(f) Why do you think the regression discontinuity results are different from the results earlier in the problem set?
